                        <p>Greetings!</p>
                        <p>Thank you for visiting my Fundraising page! Make yourself at home as I post weekly 
                        updates, photos and more as I continue on this 18-week journey.</p>
                        <p>For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Colin Rouser and I was born and raised in the 
                        wonderful city of Chicago, IL. Ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to be like my 
                        dad. Now, I finally get to fulfill one of my childhood dreams of being just like him:</p>
                        <p>I am running 26.2 miles this October in the 2014 Bank of America Chicago Marathon. 
                        I am more than excited and nervous to take on this challenge, but it is something I’ve 
                        wanted to do since I was 10 years old, and on top of that I am more than blessed with 
                        the opportunity to do it for a great cause.</p>
                        <p>I’m running the 2014 Chicago Marathon to support Mission of Our Lady of the Angels- a 
                        Catholic outreach to the poor in West Humboldt Park, one of the worst neighborhoods 
                        in Chicago. The high schools in West Humboldt Park have a 67% drop out rate, 97% of 
                        kids qualify for free or reduced lunch, and 42% of the adult population is unemployed. 
                        The need is clearly great.</p>
                        <p>The Mission addresses these needs through the eyes of faith. The Mission feeds about 
                        700 families a month, supports about 900 youth a month in afterschool programming 
                        (in a partnership with the YMCA and the Greater Chicago Food Depository), has a 
                        community group for senior citizens, host bi-weekly community dinners to help rebuild 
                        the broken families in our neighborhood, and, most importantly, provides a prayer 
                        presence in the face of violence and poverty.</p>
                        <p>To find out more about the Mission, please visit their website here: <a href='http://www.missionola.com'>Missionola.com</a></p>
                        <p>I am committed to train (running over 500 miles) over the long, hot summer and run 
                        26.2 miles on Marathon Sunday (October 12) . . . along with 60+ other runners to 
                        help finance the needs of the Church. I would appreciate all your prayers to help me 
                        persevere through my training and finish the race.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I need your financial support. The Mission is able to provide all of its services 
                        to its neighbors for free because of many generous donations from people like you. 
                        After recently completing a gigantic capital campaign, the Mission is working on better 
                        establishing its programming in the neighborhood, and needs your help to do that.</p>
                        <p>I set up this page to make it easier to follow my training progress and enjoy some of the 
                        stories and adventures I have along the way. And if you are able to donate, please visit 
                        my donation page; you will find instructions on how to donate and special offers. Any 
                        and all help you can provide is more than appreciated.</p>
