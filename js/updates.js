I am tired. For the first time, I feel like I have run over 400 miles, as though the weight of each step is very present in my legs. My feet are tender, my joints ache and I am very, very sore all of the time. Recovery and days off seem to be shorter and shorter, my ice sessions are longer and longer and yet I am still 6. Weeks. Away. How can I possibly do this? How much more of this can my body take before I call it quits?'}, {p:'It’s times like this that remind me of why I am doing this and whom I am doing this for. There are numerous people without homes in Chicago who look to the Mission on a daily basis as a source of salvation and hope. People whose feet have been tender for years, joints aching for years and who have been sore longer than I have been alive. Regardless of whatever situation in life that has brought them in need of the Mission, the fact remains that they need help. This alone motivates me to do better. This motivates me to push on. Although my pain is physical and temporary, my faith, spirituality and resolve remain unbroken. Regardless of the shape I may be in come the big day, I know I will have done everything I can in order to aid the Mission in helping those who cannot help themselves. I can only hope that the small sacrifice of my time and energy can make a big difference in someone else’s life; it’s the least I can do.

I finally feel like I have made substantial progress in my training. For starters, the small aches and pains I have had are all but gone and my toes have happily healed (they must’ve finally gotten used to the heavy workload). That and I’m closer to the mileage I need in order to run the marathon, having peaked at 18 miles this week for my long run. Honestly, I couldn’t be happier; with 19 weeks of training, all of the hard work I have put in this far is finally starting to pay off. I am very thankful to God for helping me find focus and dedication these weeks, as well as my health. I have learned a lot about my work ethic and resolve, and the level of commitment it takes to be successful at such an endeavor.'}, {p:'Hard work is something that is essential for success. It is truly immeasurable; for no standard amount of quantifiable work can guarantee any same person the appropriate success he or she seeks. Then why is it essential for success? Because hard work introduces you to something that you may not always see very clearly, but is always present in anything you are passionate about: resolve. Resolve, to me, is basically the internal conversation I have had with my heart many times. It goes something like this: “How far are you willing to go to get what you want? How much are you willing to sacrifice? To change? Are you sure you can do this?” Sound familiar? I hear this voice in almost everything I do, whether it’s lacing up my shoes to run or leaving for work in the morning. This voice will always be present whenever you pursue something your passionate about, and I feel it is my duty to listen to it and to test my limits. See, hard work is not the list of ridiculous things you had to do to justify your position in life, but to me it is what it took to answer those questions in your heart to satisfy that resolve. So as I look out over the beautiful city of Minneapolis reflecting on my accomplishments in this journey so far, I hope to continue to answer those questions as I am presented new challenges in each opportunity afforded to me in life. And I hope you will do the same.'}, {p:'Peace and Blessings,'}, {p:'CSR'}]

I know a lot of you are thinking “DUH Colin, where were you in the first grade when they explained all of this?” I am obviously not new to the concept of feet, but NOTHING makes you appreciate them more than bruised toes. NOTHING. Today was my first experience with legitimate training aches and pains, ones that decided to stick around long after my run. I suppose the pavement I have been training on was a bit much, because at the conclusion of my 14 miler this week I found it very difficult to walk. So difficult In fact, had to remove my shoes immediately and found my feet were very swollen and hurt to the touch. Have I really just bruised my toes? My ever so valuable and hardworking toes??'}, {p:'No one told me about that when I signed up to train!

Not everyone was given the same blessings, so it is easy to forget what God has granted each and every one of us in our daily lives. In this instance, it took a bad case of bruised toes for me to realize what a blessing it is to walk everyday, let alone run. It has given me a sense of perspective and refocusing as I close in on these final 9 weeks. As much as I want to succeed and accomplish my personal goals in running this marathon, I am painfully reminded now that I am not just doing this for myself, but for countless others less fortunate than I. Not only will I take better care of my feet, but I will remember to thank God for all of the blessings I have, including the opportunity to do this.'}, {p:'More ice it is!'}, {p:'Peace and Blessings,'}, {p:'CSR'}]

For those who know me, you know how I feel about helping others. For those who don’t, I am a firm believer that it is our duty to extend a helping hand however we are able, whenever we are able. Regardless of how busy our lives may be or how important things are, there are always others who, for one reason or another, need help. Everyone needs love and care in this world in order to thrive and live out their lives. Some of us are blessed to have it while others are in a constant struggle to find it. If you know someone in need of help, reach out. Offer to listen or to help. The impact that we can each have on one another is truly underrated. With every small mile that I allowed to run, I know that the funds that I am helping to raise will help to make a difference in someone’s life. This motivates me everyday to get back out there and train and advocate for the less fortunate. It’s not much, but a small part that I can play in making a difference for someone else because I am able. With that, another week down, and 10 to go!
